### Prerequisites

1. **LocationIQ API Key**: You need a free LocationIQ API key for geocoding services:

   - No credit card required
   - Enterprise-grade geocoding accuracy

### Setup Instructions

1. **Get LocationIQ API Key**:
   - Go to [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Go to your dashboard and create a new API token
   - Copy your API access token

2. **Configure the API Key**:
   - **For Local Development**: Copy `config.local.example.js` to `config.js` and add your LocationIQ API key
   - **For GitHub Pages**: Add your API key to GitHub Secrets (see deployment section below)

3. **Run the Application**:
   - **Local**: Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - **GitHub Pages**: Push to GitHub and enable Pages in repository settings
   - **Local Server**: Use `python -m http.server` or similar for full functionality

## üåê GitHub Pages Deployment with LocationIQ API

This application uses GitHub Actions to securely deploy with your LocationIQ API key:

### **Automatic Deployment Setup:**

1. **Add API Key to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `LOCATIONIQ_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your LocationIQ API key

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - Save settings

3. **Deploy**:
   - Push your code to the `main` branch
   - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site
   - Your app will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

**Secure API Key Handling**: Your API key is stored securely in GitHub Secrets and injected during build time, never exposed in your public repository.

### Using a Local Server (Recommended for Development)

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

```
travel-planner/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file

## üé® Customization

### Color Themes
You can customize the color scheme by modifying the CSS variables in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #667eea;
    --secondary-color: #764ba2;
    --accent-color: #f093fb;
}
```

### Map Styles
The application uses OpenStreetMap tiles with Leaflet.js for map rendering. You can customize the tile layer in `script.js` if needed.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Map not loading**:
   - Check your LocationIQ API key in config.js
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection
   - Check browser console for error messages

2. **Geocoding not working**:
   - Verify Geocoding API is enabled
   - Check API quotas and billing

3. **Locations not saving**:
   - Ensure localStorage is enabled in your browser
   - Try clearing browser cache and cookies

### API Quotas

LocationIQ API limits (free tier):
- 5,000 requests per day for geocoding
- No credit card required for free tier
- Generous limits for personal and small business use

## üîê Security Notes

- Consider restricting your LocationIQ API key to specific domains in production
- Consider implementing server-side proxy for API calls in production environments
- The current implementation stores data locally - consider adding user authentication for multi-device access

## üåü Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- User authentication and cloud storage
- Collaborative trip planning
- Integration with booking platforms
- Weather information
- Budget tracking
- Photo attachments
- Social sharing
